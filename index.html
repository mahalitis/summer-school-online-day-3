                <h2>About HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design the structure of
                    web pages. It provides the basic framework for websites by using a system of elements or tags to
                    define different parts of content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML acts
                    as the backbone of web development, allowing browsers to interpret and display the content
                    correctly. Although HTML by itself doesn’t include styling or interactivity, it works closely with
                    CSS for design and JavaScript for functionality to build fully-featured, responsive web pages.</p>

                <h2>About JavaScript</h2>
                <p> JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language used to add interactivity, logic, and
                    dynamic behavior to web pages. Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on structure and styling, JavaScript
                    enables web pages to respond to user actions—such as clicks, form submissions, or keyboard
                    input—without needing to reload the page. It runs directly in the browser, making it essential for
                    creating modern web applications like online forms, interactive maps, image sliders, and real-time
                    updates. JavaScript is also widely used in server-side development through environments like
                    Node.js, making it a versatile language for both front-end and back-end development.

                <h2>About CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of
                    HTML elements on a web page. While HTML provides the structure, CSS is responsible for how that
                    structure looks—such as colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness across different
                    screen sizes. By separating design from content, CSS makes it easier to maintain and update
                    websites. It allows developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, from
                    simple styling to complex animations and grid layouts. CSS works alongside HTML and JavaScript to
                    deliver a complete and polished web experience.</p>

                <h2>Boost Your Productivity</h2>
                <p>Boosting productivity in coding involves adopting smart practices and habits that help you write
                    efficient, clean, and error-free code. One of the key strategies is to break down complex problems
                    into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them step by step. Using version control tools like Git,
                    setting up a clean development environment, and utilizing shortcuts or extensions in your code
                    editor can save valuable time. Additionally, writing reusable functions, maintaining clear code
                    structure with proper comments, and regularly debugging and testing your code can significantly
                    improve workflow. Staying focused, avoiding multitasking, and taking short breaks using techniques
                    like Pomodoro can also help maintain energy and mental clarity, leading to more productive coding
                    sessions.</p>

                <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
                <p>Full Stack Development refers to the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end parts of a
                    web application. A full stack developer is skilled in designing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, as well as building and managing server-side logic, databases, and APIs using
                    technologies like Node.js, Python, PHP, or Java. This role requires a broad understanding of how the
                    entire web application functions—from the visual layout and user experience to the database
                    structure and server communication. Full stack development offers flexibility, faster development
                    cycles, and the ability to troubleshoot issues across the entire application, making it a highly
                    valuable skill in the tech industry.</p>
